-Tool ideas go here.

Grapple Hook
Wall Jump
Climbing Hooks	~This lends very well to the climbing aspect of the game, and we can then make more vertical levels around this~
	(instead of jumping off walls you can grab onto them and climb up them)
	with this, we could also introduce the ability to jump up a wall, a little each time,
	and have surfaces that can be grabbed onto and not grabbed onto.
Gliding

Power Strike (charge up time, more damage, higher knockback, breaks stuff)


-Upgrades to exisitng tools and abilities-
Air Dodge
	Multi-directional dodge ('dodging' up, down and diagonals)
Double Jump
	additional jumps
Charge or bracing jumps (i.e. press and hold down, after a second the characters flashes, and you can jump farther and higher)
